## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript (vanilla)

I chose Javascript because it's simple enough to run on a browser without any server-side processing.
The only drawback is that good'ol' vanilla JS tends to spaghettify when code base starts to grow, but in
this case the application is short enough to be easy to mantain or add features.
In any case, with current ES functionalities, it'd be possible to modularize or refactor the app in order to make it even easier to mantain.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I haven't used any 3rd party libraries. The reason for that is because in the present day, a simple
application can be written just using any browser's available APIs.

## Installation / Run

Project doesn't need a web server it can just run locally.

Instructions:

Download or clone the repository, and open the `index.html` file on any browser.

The following components must be installed locally:

- A modern ES6 and CSS3 compliant browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Safari...)

To run the project locally, enter the following in the command line / bash:
